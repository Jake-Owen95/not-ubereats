  Not UberEats
</h1>
<p>
This website was created to help showcase local restaurants in Cape Town who offer their own delivery service or pick up options.

By showcasing these restaurants we hope that we can help struggling businesses during this difficult time, putting more money in their pockets instead of third-party companies such as UberEats.

**About my contribution:**

This project is forked from Randy Singh's github. He wanted the code to be open source for anyone to use and I wanted to bring this website to South Africa. So I forked his repository and got the contentful CMS set up and running, I added a dotenv file with various access keys and tokens setting those up on the carious platforms. 

I then edited the website to show South African restuarants and context. Set up the google places api and google analytics. Sourced restaurants and popluated the site with each ones data via the contentful CMS. 

Set up domain name at: www.not-uberEats.co.za and hosted the site on netlify for continuios deployment. Fixed bugs such as the sort by distance button not working as a result of restaurant entries having incorrect map locations. 

I still manage and maintain the South African site.
